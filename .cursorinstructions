Project: Proof of Concept for AI Memory with RAG

Objective:

To create a proof of concept system that allows users to upload/export their ChatGPT conversation history, process it into a vector database for memory retrieval, and interact with an AI interface enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to simulate memory and lifelike responses.

Instructions for Development AI (OpenHands):

Phase 1: Understanding the ChatGPT Data File

Research the ChatGPT export file format:

Locate documentation or examples of the file format generated from the ChatGPT Export Data feature.

Identify how conversations are structured (e.g., JSON format, conversation-level metadata, timestamps).

Extract and Preprocess Data:

Parse the file to extract individual conversations.

Organize data into manageable chunks, ensuring each chunk has enough semantic context but is small enough for efficient embeddings (e.g., 200-500 tokens).

Phase 2: Vectorization and Storage

Chunk and Embed Data:

Use an embeddings model, such as OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, to generate vector embeddings for each chunk of conversation.

Ensure embeddings retain semantic meaning for conversational queries.

Select and Implement a Vector Store:

Evaluate options like Redis, Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

Recommendation: Use Redis if simplicity and local storage are priorities. If scalability is important, explore Pinecone.

Load Data into the Vector Store:

Index the embeddings with metadata (e.g., conversation ID, timestamp, original text).

Phase 3: Query Interface Setup

Interface Design:

Create a simple web-based chat interface replicating the ChatGPT experience.

Include fields for user prompts and AI responses.

Integrate RAG Pipeline:

When a user submits a query:

Use the query to generate an embedding.

Perform a similarity search in the vector store to retrieve top-N semantically relevant chunks.

Append retrieved memories to the prompt context for the AI API call.

AI Response Generation:

Use the ChatGPT API to generate responses.

Include retrieved memories in the prompt, framing them as past interactions (e.g., "It's like when we talked about...").

Ensure responses adapt seamlessly to user input tone and topic.

Phase 4: Upload/Replace Functionality

File Upload System:

Build a feature to upload new ChatGPT export files.

Replace or merge the existing vector database entries with the new data.

Automated Processing:

Automatically extract, preprocess, embed, and store the uploaded data upon file upload.

Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

Simulate Memory-Like Behavior:

Test AI responses for appropriate use of memories.

Refine the memory retrieval system to prioritize relevance and conversational flow.

Optimize for Lifelike Interaction:

Add logic for when and how retrieved memories should be referenced (e.g., "Do you remember..." or "As we discussed...").

Avoid overuse to maintain naturalness.

Deliverables:

A web-based interface replicating the ChatGPT experience, enhanced with RAG for memory simulation.

A backend capable of:

Processing and embedding ChatGPT export files.

Storing embeddings in a vector database.

Querying and retrieving relevant chunks during interactions.

Documentation for:
